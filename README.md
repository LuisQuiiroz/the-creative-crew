Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  
  [Here](https://the-creative-crew-q.netlify.app/)
  
- What was your experience?
  
  Work with images in different positions depending on the resolution of the screen
  
- What have you learned/improved?
  
  Use the :nth-child() CSS pseudo-class and add styles to certain siblings
  
- Your wisdom? :)

  Everything is possible with patience and creativity
